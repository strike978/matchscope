## [0.1.5-alpha] - 2025-07-04

### Major Changes

- **Modern UI with Flet:**  
  Migrated from a classic Tkinter interface to a modern, responsive Flet desktop app with Material Design elements.

- **Real-Time Ethnicity Visualization:**  
  Ethnicity regions for each match are now displayed as interactive horizontal bar charts, replacing plain text.

- **Progress & Status Feedback:**  
  Added a progress bar and live status labels for both match retrieval and processing, giving clear feedback throughout.  
  The app now tracks and displays progress based on the number of matches being processed, rather than focusing on pages.

- **Improved Error Handling:**  
  Errors and completion messages are shown in a snackbar for better visibility.

### Fixed & Improved

- **Match-Based Progress:**  
  Progress and status now reflect the number of matches being fetched and processed, not the number of pages, making the workflow more intuitive and user-focused.

**Summary:**  
This release is a complete overhaul of MatchScope, transforming it from a basic Tkinter tool into a modern, user-friendly desktop app with advanced visualization, robust progress tracking, and a much improved, match-centric workflow.
